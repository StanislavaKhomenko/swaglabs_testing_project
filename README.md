# swaglabs_testing_project
Pet project of automation testing using pytest and Selenium WebDriver. Test website: https://www.saucedemo.com/ (Swag Labs)
Following POM model, all Page Classes are stored in the /pages folder. Web elements are stored in the locators.py file. In this pet project, I created test methods for 4 main pages of the testing website: Login page (test_login_page.py), Product page (test_product_page.py), Cart page (test_cart_page.py) and Checkout flow (test_checkout_flow) as a part of Cart Page Class.
